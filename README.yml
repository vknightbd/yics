YICS: YAML In C#

Definitions:
  document:
    - a document start token is three dashes
    - a document end token is three dots
    - a stream with many documents will have many start tokens and end tokens
    - before a document start or after a document end, directives can be used
  sequence: 
    - list of nodes (shortened as seq, or seqs plural)
    - each node is value
  hash: 
    - list of mappings of node to node
    - first node in mapping is key; second node is value
    - space between key and colon is trimmed
  node: a scalar or a collection
  collection: a sequence or hash
  block: 
    - style where indentation indicates hierarchy
    - items in collections are delimited by newlines
  flow: 
    - style where square brackets indicates seqs and curly braces for hashes
    - items in collections are delimited by commas
    - leading spaces are ignored and does not count towards indentation
  compact block: 
    - block style in that multi-line values are not on a separate line from 
      the dash or colon and that the indent of the value is 
  anchor: 
    - a word prepended by ampersand symbol
    - must appear before the value
    - word does not need to be unique
  alias:
    - a word prepended by asterix symbol
    - the word is the same as a previously defined anchor
    - if multiple anchors have the same name, the alias refers to the previous one
    - cannot appear before the anchor is defined
  scalars:
    both block and flow: 
      - all trailing whitespace are ignored
      - empty lines are treated as a significant newline
      - empty lines at the end of a string are chomped away
    block style:
      all:
        - last newline is significant
        - all leading whitespace after indent is significant
        - indentation indicator: 
            - number right after block starting token to tell indentation level for
              when first content line contains leading space characters
            - if indicator is not specified, and lines before non empty
              content line contain more leading spaces, it is an error and indicator
              must be specified!
            - if indicator is specified, the indent is temporary for that block
              only, and can even be indented less than the parent block!
        - block chomping indicators:
          - none means keep last newline (default)
          - dash strips last newline
          - plush keeps last newline plus extra trailing newlines
      literal:
        - starts with pipe character
        - all newlines are significant
      folded:
        - starts with greater than sign
        - newlines are folded into spaces
        - newline for lines with leading whitespace after indent is significant
        - insert newline before lines with leading whitespace after indent
        - newline before an empty line is significant
    flow style:
      all:
        - all leading whitespace all ignored
        - newlines are folded into spaces
      plain:
        - not using quotes, end of scalar is determined by newline and reduced indent
      single quotes: 
        - starts and ends a string with single quotes
        - whitespace after opening quote is significant (special case)
        - escaping single quotes within a string is done by doubling single quotes
      double quotes:
        - starts and ends a string with double quotes
        - whitespace after opening quote is significant (special case)
        - does not use doubled single quotes
        - also allows escape sequences like control, unicode, and hex escapes

Project:
  YAML:
    - everything is a value
    - all collections are lists at heart
    - sequences can be seen as mappings with integer keys
    - mappings can be collection-collection pairs using question mark and colon
    - anchors must appear before aliases
    - (todo) tag uri scheme, local tags, canonial tags
    - node comparison (3.2.1.3), must read tags or generate them in case of scalars
    - for comparing collection nodes, it is probably easiest to produce the 
      canonial form of the collection (i.e. turn it into string) and then compare
      the canonial forms (string equality)
    - tokens question, dash, and colon are part of the indentation,
      but the space/tab after it is not part of indent
    - comments start with a pound sign with whitespace before and after
    - comments can even appear inside a string!
    - if a comment appears before a value, be prepared for multiline comments
    - be wary to deferentiate between multiline comments, and strings that start
      with pound symbol after indent
    - empty lines are allowed between tokens for separation
    - whitespace are allowed between tokens for separation
    - for node properties, anchor and tag, do not have order to be specified
    - flow nodes can be embedded in block nodes, but not vice-versa!

  Load: 
    - 
      Relational Trees, if YICS encounters a list of hashes, 
      YICS will look for the smallest hash in the list and determine if its`
      key-value pairs are repeated at least twice in other hashes.  
      If so, the smallest hash is given an anchor, and other hashes are given
      a reference and hash merge.
    -
      For hashes where the keys and values are scalars, 
      if keys in a hash are less than 12 characters long, YICS will
      attempt to line up the colons so that the values will also line up.
  Dump:
    - if a string contains a pound symbol prepended by whitespace,
      then the string must be dumped in quoted style (not plain style)
  Options:
    debug dump: dump with all tags explicit in block style
